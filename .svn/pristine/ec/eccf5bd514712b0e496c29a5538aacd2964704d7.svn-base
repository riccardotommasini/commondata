<p> This document provides basic statistics about the topology of the <a href="../index.html">Web Data Commons - Hyperlink Graph</a> extracted from the Common Crawl Corpus released in April 2014, covering 1.7 billion web pages and 64 billion hyperlinks between these pages. The graph was extracted from the Spring 2014 web corpus of the Common Crawl Foundation. This corpus was gathered using a modified <a href="http://nutch.apache.org/">Apache Nutch</a> crawler to gather pages from a seed list without discovering links while crawling. The seed list,containing around 6 billion URLs was provided by the search engine company <a href="http://blekko.com/">blekko</a> where the crawl corpus contains around 2 billion of those pages. The Common Crawl Foundation and blekko started a cooperation in 2013 to increase the quality and popularity of the crawled pages and reduce the number of crawled spam pages and crawler traps.
</br>
</br>
The graph of 2014 is well connected (91% of all nodes) the largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component">strongly connected component</a> consists of only 19% of all nodes, which is most like due to the selected crawling strategy. Nevertheless we encourage the usage of this graph datasets but <font color="red">for analysis of the connectivity of the pages within the web and structural studies we recommend to use the <a href="../2012-08/topology.html">2012 graph dataset</a>, as a BFS based selection strategy including link discovery while crawling most likely results in a more realistic sample of the structure of the Web.</font>

<h2 id="examples">1. Page Graph</h2>
<p>
This graph contains of over 1.7 billion nodes which are connected by over 64 billion arcs which are retrieved from the extracted hyperlinks of a crawled page. 
In the following we present the analysis of the degree and the components of the graph as well as the sizes of the bow-tie components, which can be found within the graph and was first introduced in the work <a href="http://www9.org/w9cdrom/160/160.html">Graph structure in the web</a> by Broder et al. in 2000.
</p>
</p>
<h3>1.1 Indegree and Outdegree Distribution</h3>
<p>
The following two figures show frequency plots of indegrees
and outdegrees in log-log scale. For each <code>d</code>, we plot a point with
an ordinate equal to the number of pages with that have degree <code>d</code>. Note that
<i>we included the data for degree zero</i>, which is omitted in most of the
literature. We then aggregate the values using <i>Fibonacci
binning</i> to show the approximate shape of the distribution.
We find the page with the highest indegree to be referenced by of 45 million other pages and
the page with the largest number of links to contain almost 32 thousand references to other pages.

<h3>1.2 Connected Components</h3>
<p>
The following figure (left) shows the distribution of the sizes of the
weakly connected components using a visualization similar to the previous
figures. The largest component (rightmost grey point) contains about around 91% of
the whole graph (over 1.54 billion pages).<br\>
The right shows the distribution of the sizes of the strongly connected components. 
The largest component (rightmost grey point) contains 18.95% (over 326 million pages).

</p>

<h3>1.3 Bow-Tie Structure</h3>
<p>
Having identified the giant strongly connected component, we can determine 
the so-called <i>bow tie</i>, a depiction of the structure of the web
suggested by Broder et al..
The bow tie is made of six different components:
<ul>
<li>the core is given by the giant strongly connected component (LSCC);</li>
<li>the IN component contains non-core pages that can reach the core via a directed path;</li>
<li>the OUT component contains non-core pages that can be reached from the core;</li>
<li>the TUBES are formed by non-core pages reachable from IN and that can reach OUT;</li>
<li>pages reachable from IN, or that can reach OUT, but are not listed above, are called TENDRILS;</li>
<li>the remaining pages are DISCONNECTED. </li>
</ul>

All these components are easily computed by visiting the <i>direct acyclic graph of strongly connected components</i> (SCC DAG):
it is a graph having one node for each strongly connected component with an arc from <code>x</code> to <code>y</code> if some node in the
component associated with <code>x</code> is connected with a node in the component associated with <code>y</code>. 
The bow tie of the page graph is shown in the following figure:

<!--
<h2>2. Pay-Level-Domain Graph</h2>
<p>
The PLD Graph is created from the Page Graph by aggregating all pages that belong to a pay-level-domain (PLD) into a single node. For example, the pay-level-domain of <code>dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de</code> is <code>uni-mannheim.de</code>. All pages under one PLD are aggregated into one node and all internal links are removed. External links, i.e. those leading to other PLDs, are kept, but only once. 
<br>The PLD graph consists of over 43 million websites/nodes and over 623 million distinct arcs between those nodes.</p>

<h3>2.1 Weakly and Strongly Connected Components</h3>

<p>The PLD graph contains one giant weakly connected component that consists of 39.4 million nodes (92%). The following diagrams show the distribution of the weakly connected components (WCC) and the strongly connected components (SCC) in the PLD graph. The x-axis charts the size of the components and the y-axis draws the number of components for a particular size. Both axes are log-scaled. 
    The respective distribution is marked by the blue dots and the calculated power law distributions are shown as black lines.
    The distribution of the sizes of WCCs follows a power law with an exponent of 1.411. The power law is calculated excluding the giant component.</p>

<h3>2.2 In- and Out-Degree Distribution</h3>

<p>The following diagrams show the in- and out-degree distributions of the PLD graph.
    The respective distribution is marked by the blue dots and the calculated power law distributions are shown as black lines.

Both distributions follow a power law, where the exponent for in-degree is 1.56 and the exponent for the out-degree distribution is 1.49.</p>

</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<br>


</p>

<h3 id="bowtie">2.3 Bow-Tie</h3>
<p> We further determine the Bow-Tie structure of the PLD Graph. The Bow-Tie structure consists of the largest strongly connected component (LSCC) that is flanked by two other components, IN and OUT.
    The IN component contains all nodes that are not part of the LSCC, but are connected to it via a directed path.
    Similarly, the OUT component contains nodes that are, via a directed path, reachable from the LSSC.
    Connected to the IN and OUT component, there are TENDRILS that lead away from the IN or towards the OUT component respectively.
    If two such TENDRILS are connected, they form TUBES.
    The TUBES component contains nodes that directly connect the IN and OUT components, without going through the LSCC.
    All remaining nodes, i.e. those that are not part of the largest weakly connected component, belong to the DISCONNECTED component.
</p>

<h3>2.4 Frequently Interlinked PLDs</h3>

<p>We also identified weakly connected components (WCC) of frequently interlinked websites. The picture below shows one WCC in which all websites are interlinked by at least 500,000 links connecting individual pages of both websites.
</p>

<h3>2.7 Linkage of Websites grouped by TLD</h3>
<p>
Beside the general connectivity of the different pay-level-domains we analysed the connectivity of pay-level-domains 
between the different top-level-domains they belong to.
The figure below shows the hyperlinks of the pay-level-domains aggregated by their top-level-domain of the 10 largest TLDs.
All remaining domains are collected in the group named "others".
In this diagram, the outermost circle labelled with percentages represents the total number of links for each group.
Directly adjacent to this circle are two smaller bars for each group. The outer bar represents the number of in-links while the inner bar represents the number of out-links.
Further to the centre there is another circle labelled with absolute numbers.
This circle, again, represents the total number of links.
From this circle ribbons spanning through the middle represent interconnections between the different groups.
Incoming links have a white gap between the ribbon spanning in the middle and the circle part labelled with absolute numbers. 
Also, the ribbon has the same colour as the group that it originates from.

<br>
For the two largest groups of websites, ".com" and ".de" we find that the percentage of intra-TLD links is outstandingly high.
These domains tend to strongly link within their top-level-domain.
The opposite we find for the ".org"- and ".net"-TLDs. 
Both only have a small fraction of intra-TLD-links compared to inter-TLD-links.
