<p>And on a side note, if he comes crawling back and says he&#8217;s not giving up on you then is it a bad idea to even try and stay friends?</p>
<p>VictorM: The second chance shouldn&#8217;t be given to him; it should be something you do for yourself if you feel you are better off giving the relationship another try, if nothing else, to remove the &#8220;what if&#8221; from your mind.</p>
