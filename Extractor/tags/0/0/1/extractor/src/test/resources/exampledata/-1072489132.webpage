We&#8217;re both clear with the fact that it&#8217;s not going any further. Still, if he doesn&#8217;t contact me at all in a whole week, it&#8217;s not needy and annoying if I try to contact and make plans with him, right? How does it make me look if I&#8217;m the one who calls him?</p>
<p>VictorM: He&#8217;s expecting you to be the one to call him.  So if you want to spend time with him, call him. </p>

But for the past six months I&#8217;ve been desperately trying to get him back and prove to him that I&#8217;ll do anything to make him happy. We still have sex and hook up every other week and his excuse is he &#8220;doesn&#8217;t want to do it with random girls&#8221;. I just want him back in my arms again and for him to trust me. But he says it won&#8217;t work because it&#8217;s too messed up and he &#8230; <span class="more-link"><a href="http://argville.com/?p=5990" title="Continue reading this entry">Continue Reading</a></span></p>

A man with whom I was previously a &#8220;fb&#8221; with broke off the &#8220;f&#8221; part of the relationship with me, because he told me that I am too complicated for him, and he doesn&#8217;t have time for the &#8220;drama&#8221; of being intimate with me.

Asked me out. I’ve always found him attractive. We connected. Been dating at least 3x/wk since mid-Feb. We have sex, but not always… he lives 45 minutes from me so we usually stay at each other’s place and sometimes just talk and make out… and always laugh and have fun. He went on vacation for 2 ½ weeks on a trip he’d planned awhile back.
