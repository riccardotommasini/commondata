_:node6dab3cb0233ce8adc7cceb7a5edbbb33 <http://purl.org/stuff/rev#text> "Cross Sells! Beware when signing up for this site, it uses pre-checked boxes on the signup page. If these options are not unchecked, you will automatically be signed up to  unrelated sites which will charge you monthly if not cancelled.\nTrial Notice! This site's membership trial only gives you limited access. You will not be able to access all content or parts of the site.\n\nToday we're taking a look at a bisexual site that features bi threesomes.  Bi Curiosity focuses on M/M/F - or Male/Male/Female - content.  The guys here suck cock, eat pussy and fuck both guys and gals.  The tour shows a handful of episodes with preview thumbs, a description and a trailer.  The trailers are offered in your choice of WMV or MPG formats, but I already took a peek inside the member area and the actual movies are WMV only.  The tour doesn't make a lot of claims, so I'm off to the member area to take a closer look at Bi Curiosity!\nThe Bi Curiosity main member page has no menu - most of the content is right there on the page.  Near the top of the page are links to 11 bi and group sex feeds.  Next comes links to pages 2, 3 and 4 of the episodes followed by links to the first 13 episodes - which makes the main member page episode page 1.  Each episode is offered wtih links to both downloadable and streaming video clips, links to pics and a description.  There is also a date on each episode, but without a year - we'll talk about these shortly.  Under the episodes are 6 advertising banners followed by a huge collection of bonus sites and feeds.  Links to bi, gay and straight bonus content is near the bottom of the page and last is the customer support page.   It takes a lot of scrolling to get to the bottom of this page, but overall the layout is simple. \nLet's start off with what we're really here to see - the videos.  Afterward we'll get to the other stuff including the updates.\nMost of the videos inside Bi Curiosity are Male/Male/Female videos, with sexual interaction between both guys as well as between each guy and the girl.  But a few of the vids are Male/Female/Female, which - though technically bisexual content - isn't what is usually thought of as bisexual in adult.\nThe Bi Curiosity movies are WMVs that are offered in both streaming and downloadable vids in 2 sizes.  Most of the high speed  movies are shown at 320x240 although I did find a few shown at 420x280.  Bitrates vary, but most of the newer videos have a bitrate of around 496k and the oldest closer to 560k.  While some of the videos - the 560k ones - look pretty good when enlarged to 200%, most of the videos are blurry but bearable when enlarged.  The better lit vids are sharper and crisper, and they hold up better when enlarged.  You can generally tell which ones these are as the preview thumbs are also brighter and crisper.  Sound is good and videos play smoothly.  The low speed movies are suitable for dialup users.  A piece of good news is that the videos here use no DRM so if you save some, they're yours to keep. \nMost of the pic sets here are vidcaps, and are fairly standard vidcaps in both quality and size.  While they are a great way to get an idea of the action in the videos, these are on the lower end of the quality spectrum.  Some of the older videos come with a set of digital stills, however.  These are medium in size and average quality, which puts them way ahead of the vidcaps.  Pic lovers might want to go through the older episodes as they may well find something they'll like.\nThere is plenty of bonus content here from a variety of sources, which means quality and size of videos varies.  While there is a good deal of content here, it doesn't seem to have been chosen with Bi Curiosity in mind.  Still, for those who like a variety of porn, the bonus content does add value for members.  There are also some straight and gay bonus pics and videos.  I believe that the bonus content and sites are only available to full members and not to trial members.\nNow let's talk about the dates on the episodes.  As I mentioned, there are no years - just the month and day listed.  Did the site update this year or another year?  Who knows?  When you go to the bottom of the main member page, you'll find a link that says \" What's New\".  This is a page listing some straight pic sets that say they were added over 2 years ago in 2005.  By looking on the web, I discovered that Bi Curiosity has been around since 2003, so it appears that the site no longer updates since it would have a lot more videos by now.\nBi Curiosity offers just under 60 bisexual videos in WMV clips that can be downloaded or streamed and comes with a set of pics.  The high speed videos are shown at 320x240, which is on the small side, and quality is average.   Each video also comes with a lower speed version for dialup users.  I have mixed feelings about the site as I like the videos but I prefer my movies bigger and better quality.  Also it's pretty unlikely that this site updates.  Still, it does have a nice collection of mostly Male/Male/Female sex vids and a good sized collection of bonus content.  If seeing two guys and a girl fucking turns you on, and you don't mind smaller videos, Bi Curiosity is a site you should check out.\nThings we liked:\n\n   Vids are downloadable\nNo DRM\nSeveral bi feeds\nVids for dialup users\n\nThings we didn't like:\n\n Site does not update\nVideos are on small side\nContent could be better quality\nPrechecked offer on join page\nNo full scenes - only clips\nToo many banners on main page\n\nClick here to visit Bi Curiosity\nMembership prices ( CCBill\u00A0\nPaycom\u00A0)\n\nTrial: $1 (3 days trial, recurring 30 days at $39.95)\nMonthly: $29.96 (recurring every 30 days)" <http://www.gaydemon.com/reviews/Bi_Curiosity.html>   .

_:nodedbf144b0da3912056ee11bcd9854a10 <http://purl.org/stuff/rev#text> "Turkish men aren't technically Arab, but they share many of the same qualities and features - their darker skin and hair, their hairy bodies, their sexy brown eyes.  Being the gateway to and from the Mediterranean Sea made Turkey an important point of commerce. This mixing and co-mingling of a variety of people and cultures has, over the centuries, created a very exotic and striking population of men. Istanboys puts the focus on Turkish men from guys in their younger 20s, some almost twink-like, to more mature and muscular 30-year-olds. And there's a variety of action from solo jack-off to hardcore gay sex.\nThe Istanboys member area didn't thrill me.  For a start, the navigation is all accomplished with dropdown menus in frames, although if you choose the selection that says IstanBoys Content, you will be taken to all the photo sets.  Then there's the list of updates on the member home page.  There were 2 things of note about the updates list - one is that there are no videos listed out of the 32 most recent updates, and the other is that there are no dates on the updates, so there's no way to know when this site last added content.  Another thing you'll want to know is that the links to \"Home\" around the site won't take you to the member home page - they'll take you to the index for the section you're in.  If you want to head back to the member home, click the Istanboys logo at the top left of every page on the frame. \nThere are a good amount of non-exclusive photo sets inside Istanboys, and there may be some exclusive sets, but I'm not sure.  Many of the pics sets are sets that I've seen in other sites with the guys listed with different names and their ethnicity given as latino or italian.  Photo quality varies here, ranging from amateur to good, and some sets being pretty well lit and others not too well lit.  The pics vary is size from 479x600 to 796x1200.  In some galleries, you click a thumb for a bigger pic and click the bigger pic for an even bigger version of that pic. \nThe videos are listed by format, and there are 4 different formats listed with different amounts in each format, the most vids being listed in Win Media - 32 vids - and the least in Quicktime - 25.  The videos here are on the small side, being shown at 320x240, and quality isn't too great with a bitrate of around 220k.  These are definitely not videos you'll want to enlarge to full screen.  The movies are each offered in several clips with no full scenes available.  On the other hand, they're downloadable and don't use DRM.  One thing to watch out for while you're checking out the videos - the Turkish VOD leads to pay per view videos outside the site.\nIstanboys offers their members 1 bonus site, Maximo Latino, plus a variety of gay niched feeds.  And while Maximo Latino doesn't feature Turkish men, there are some similarities between Turks and Latinos. The feeds don't feature any Arabic or Turkish guys, but there are asian, black and latin guys.  There are also links to newsgroups of photos plus offsite tourism and hotel links to Turkey.\nWhat Istanboys mostly has to offer is the fantasy of Turkish men and guys who fit the description - swarthy, dark hair and eyes, and often hairy bodies.  Overall I felt let down by Istanboys.  For one thing, the small video section hasn't grown since our last review 2 years ago, and for another the vids are small and not good quality.  For another, at least some of the guys in the pic sets aren't actually Turkish and the sets aren't exclusive.  I wasn't thrilled with the site navigation, which is on dropdowns and uses frames - and includes pay per view on the menus.  And last, although I can't be sure, it doesn't appear that the site updates - it hasn't grown much in the last 2 years.  The bottom line - if you like the guys on the tour of Istanboys, you may find the site worth joining, but don't expect much in the way of videos or updates.\nThings we liked:\n\nVideos are downloadable\nNo DRM used\nReasonable subscription price\n\nThings we didn't like:\n\nNo dates on updates - site does not seem to have updated in 2 years\nVideo section is pretty small\nVideos aren't very high quality and are small\nSite navigation issues\nMisleading links to pay per view in dropdown menus\n\nClick here to visit Istan Boys\nMembership prices ( CCBill\u00A0\n)\n\nMonthly: $19.95 (recurring at $14.95 monthly)\nQuarterly: $49.95 (non recurring)" <http://www.gaydemon.com/reviews/Istan_Boys.html>   .

Washer would would back up into the shower, the toilets kept clogging, bathtub was slow to drain along with the sinks. We tried snaking out the lines, replacing pipes all to no avail. So then we called South East Total Service and had them come out. They were very courteous, ran a TV camera into the main drain and found that the sewer line to the street had shifted and broken. They gave us 2 estimates, and very reasonable on both. They were a lot lower than most. One estimate if they had to go all the way to the street and one if they didn't. They told us how long it would take and worked with us to make sure that the city was not liable. We granted them the job. As it turned out they did not have to go all the way into the street, which saved us a lot of money. They did expert work and didn't mind if I, my wife or daughter were there to watch. They explained everything they were doing and why it had to be done that way. They used high grade products and when the job was done, it was perfect. I would highly recommend them to anyone that needed any plumbing done. We are also going to use them for some remodeling projects that we have planned. To sum it all up, they are very professional and courteous and very reasonably priced.Glen Pope" <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/15240368275>   .

_:node45581b8c697362f04d83cc7cfca1e82 <http://purl.org/stuff/rev#text> "Buzz West is a clean, thoughtfully laid out site that is easy to navigate. It's also packed with horny amateur guys who have decided to jack off on camera or even try gay sex for their first time - some even come back to do it again! Since the tour mirrors the member area, you can check out every model and also get a feel for the site without joining. There is nice selection of exclusive models, all regular guys some of whom are straight military guys. \nThis is our 4th official \"review visit\" to Buzz West. The site is a Gaydemon favorite for many reasons. The content has grown from 7 to 245 episodes and the quality is as good as when the site started - sometimes even better. The videos and pics are exclusive and the vids are downloadable, too - and there are still some of those hot amateur military and ex-military guys, so let's log in and take a closer look at Buzz West!\nSince the member area is almost identical to the tour, if you spent any time checking out the site before joining, you already know how things work. The menu is on the left side of the page and on the right you will find the latest episode plus a pic from next week's episode.  These are followed by some more recent updates. Support can be found on the bottom of the page or in the menu. You can search Buzz West by clicking Models, which takes you to a model index.  Below that is a link to Bonus Sites as well as legal stuff, links and a page for potential models. And on below all that is a new feature, Live Support, which is available about 18 hours a day.  The only ad on the page is on the left below the links.\nThere are now 245 Buzz West exclusive episodes with 1 more on the way each week. These are not pornstars or pretty boy models - they're real amateurs and average guys whose looks range from very cute to well... average. Each guy is previewed with a thumb which, when clicked, takes you to his page where you will find Buzz's description of the guy and the shoot, links to the videos and a full thumbnail gallery of pics right there on the page.\nThe pic quality here ranges from good amateur to pro-am, and can be viewed in your choice of 213x320, 426x640 or 681x1024. You can browse them as a gallery, watch them as a hands free slide show or even zoom in if you want a closer look. The guys are hot, and apparently pretty turned-on to be in front of a camera naked, so the pics are sure to get anyone into amateurs pretty heated up.\nThe videos inside Buzz West can be streamed or downloaded as you prefer. The movies are WMVs and all the Buzz West Exclusives videos are available in 3 sizes - 256k shown at 320x240, 512k shown at 480x360, and 1024k shown at 640x480. Those bitrates, btw, are approximate but very close. The videos play in Media Player. They have good sound and play smoothly.  The videos are DRM-free.  There are also streaming versions of the videos, also in WMV format and similar in size and quality.\nOne thing worth mentioning here is that the site has a download restriction - members can only download 1 video at a time.  I tried to download 2 to see what would happen, and the first download was terminated as the second video started to download.  Since I prefer to download 2 or more videos at a time when I do reviews, this was a minor annoyance.\nSome of the models are a little nervous at first, but Buzz talks to his models, and unlike some interviewers, he's not annoying or intrusive. He gets those amateurs to open up a little, then let's them get to work stroking their cocks for us. In both the videos and pics there is a good mix of closeups and full body shots, and he never misses the cumshot.  Of course, one of the changes since the site started is that there are now hardcore sessions and also massages that usually end in the model being probed and jacked off.\nIn case members want a little more porn between updates, there are now 26 bonus feeds - 17 more than on our last visit. There's a bear feed, twink feed, first timers feed and more. These feeds are all provided by a single company, so you'll notice a similarity in flavor and quality. Some of the feeds offer a pretty decent broadband (called elite) but all of these provide more cock-sucking, ass-slamming or jacking action.\nOne other thing worth mentioning is that U.S. residents can get a free DVD with each 3 month membership and 2 free DVDs for each 6 month membership.  If you're in the U.S. and were interested in amateur military guys or Buzz West DVDs, this is definitely a good incentive.\nThere are a number of changes at Buzz West since our last visit.  First off are lower prices - the monthly recurring membership is approx $5 less per month and the 3 month membership is $6 less.  The site updates once a week now rather than two, the new feature on our last visit of offering MP4 videos seems to have stopped, and there's the download restriction.  There are also more feeds to keep members busy between updates. \nBuzz West is an attractive site that is easy to use and has some interesting video and pic options. The models are all real amateurs - including many military or ex military boys - shown in good amateur quality pics and videos with several size options of both. The site updates weekly, and the new Live Help feature works great - I tried it - and the bonus content is also a plus. While some of the recent changes weren't what I'd like, in particular that I could only download 1 video at a time, I was happy about the new lower prices.  The bottom line is that Buzz West is still a great site, and if you like regular guys, amateurs and ex-military guys, you'll definitely want to check this site out.\nThings we liked:\n\nGreat amateur models\nExclusive content\nVideos are downloadable\nNo DRM used\nNew lower monthly and 3 month prices\nSite updates weekly\n\n\nThings we didn't like:\n\nNo dates on content, so no way to know when it was added\nOnly 1 video download allowed at a time\n\nClick here to visit Buzz West\nMembership prices ( CCBill\u00A0\n)\n\nMonthly: $19.97 (recurring every 30 days)\nMonthly: $29.95 (non recurring)\nQuarterly: $53.95 (recurring every 90 days) \nHalf Year: $99.95 (183 days, non recurring)" <http://www.gaydemon.com/reviews/Buzz_West.html>   .

We agreed that the price would be $75 for the diagnosis. The guy spent 2 hours trying to figure out what was wrong and then tried to convince me that I should let him replace the thermostat for $300 (a $50 part). Then he said the other thermostat was bad and the bill would have been $675! I told him I was not interested and that I would replace the part myself...to which he replied that the diagnosis would cost $150 instead of the agreed $75 due to the fact that I have two systems in the house.

_:node3efee7063a3dfaf9d2fd29c88c218e7 <http://purl.org/stuff/rev#text> "Wired Pussy is a straight BDSM site with a focus on bondage, electrical shocks and stimulation.  The site features girls being tormented or teased by electrical equipment like Violet Wands, items from ElectraStim and cattle prods being applied to some very tender places.  Unlike some BDSM sites that disappoint because the domination and sexual torture aren't real, this is one site where you won't wonder if it's real or not.  Wired Pussy shows beautiful women whose limits get tested as they endure pain, submission, discomfort and both sexual and electrical stimulation in equal measures.\nThe Wired Pussy tour shows a sample of every single episode - and there are more than 250 episodes, each with pics and videos.  The episodes have all the info I like to see including date, pics and a good sized description of the action.  And if you like what you see on the tour, the member area does not disappoint.\nThe oldest videos aren't quite as good as all the rest.  Shown at 320x240, they are in Real Player format and the girls in the videos aren't as involved with dominance, submission and electricity.  But don't worry - there are plenty of episodes here that rock - it's only the first few that show the site was finding its way to what it was soon to become.\nAll but the oldest Wired Pussy movies are available as WMVs or Real vids that can be downloaded or streamed.  Older WMVs are 320x240 but the not so old ones are shown at 640x480 and the latest are shown at up to 854x480 at 900k.  The sound is good, and conveys the very intense action perfectly.  Each scene shows comments from a very active member community including comments on the action and the models and each comment includes a rating of the scene. \nPicture lovers will be pleased.  Each episode comes plenty of pics - with your choice of hires or lores pics so you can choose your size.  The photography is a little on the amateur side, but honestly - who cares?  The newer hires pics are shown at around 900x1200 and the lores around 535x800.  There are enough photos of each shoot to satisfy very well, and you can click under the pics you like and then download them in a zip file. \nThe action inside Wired Pussy is a bondage/BDSM lover's dream.  Extreme bondage and suspension, pussy torture using clips and clamps and electricity, electrodes, electric butt plugs, cattle prods and strap-ons are only the tip of this iceberg.  The bondage is sometimes cruel and always creative as beautiful and stern doms put their submissives through their paces.  Forced orgasm, shocked nipples, predicament bondage and forced pussy licking keep these damsels in distress - and their viewers - in a state of anticipation. \nIt's obvious the Doms in this site are no novices to bondage or torture.  The ropes and straps that bind their victims are very professionally handled, and the bondage is often as beautiful as it is uncomfortable.  There's plenty of suspension here, so that many of the subs never touch the floor for periods of time, and there are also girls tied to chairs, on tables or where ever their Mistresses decide to put them.\nAt least a couple times a month, Wired Pussy members get access to a live show featuring all the BDSM activities found in the videos - but live and happening in real time.  You can talk to the Doms in advance and make requests on the forum or you can make requests during the live shows.  For those who wonder how real the action is here or for those who simply want to watch as submissive girls are tortured, tied and forced to orgasm LIVE, these shows are a great feature.\nAnd there's a feature I liked.  In the lower right corner of each page of the tour and the member area, you can choose to browse the sets as a Full View (multiple pics from each shoot), a Brief View (1 pic plus description) or No Images.  I preferred the brief view myself, but if you want a more complete preview of each episode, the full view is the way to go.\nDespite a rather plain page layout, there's very little to complain about at Wired Pussy.  While members get no access to bonus sites, it offers weekly updates plus 250 long videos and pic sets to keep even the pickiest members pretty happy.  Doms using extreme bondage, sexual torture and plenty of electrical devices keep their pretty subs under control and will surely make BDSM lovers squirm in their seats.  Exclusive downloadable videos and pic sets plus live shows make Wired Pussy a site absolutely not to be missed! \nThings we liked:\n\nAll exclusive content\nVids can be downloaded\nNo DRM used\nContent is 99% BDSM\nFavorite models are brought back for more shoots\nLong videos, large pic sets\nAction is real\n\n\nThings we didn't like:\n\nSort of plain pages\nNavigation takes a little getting used to\n\nClick here to visit Wired Pussy\nMembership prices ( Jettis\u00A0 Paycom\u00A0)\n\nMonthly: $29.75 (recurring every 30 days)\nBi Monthly: $49.75 (recurring every 60 days)\nQuarterly: $59.75 (recurring every 90 days)\nOther: $99.00 (6 months non-recurring)" <http://www.gaydemon.com/reviews/Wired_Pussy.html>   .

The colorist completely screwed up my hair color - gave me red when I specifically told them NO RED!  I went back to have it fixed and if that wasn't bad enough, the colorist was too busy with other customers and was going to have the shampoo girl (a high school student without credentials!) apply the color to my hear.  I walked out.  Like a fool I returned 10 years later willing to give them another shot since I live nearby.\nThis guy, John, their \"master colorist\" completely ruined my hair.  He not only screwed up the color (again RED when I said I want a soft neutral blonde - I even brought in a swatch!!) but my hair is so fried from the damage he had done, my mother in law thought I had gotten a bad perm!  Now I am going to have to get it cut very short and redyed somewhere else.  Not to mention that John had a very snotty attitude and actually took a personal call while he was in the middle of putting highlights in my hair.  The result was fried, blotchy hair where the ends were darker, alot of dark red streaks, the blonde streaks were brassy and stripey.  ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!  This guy did not even LISTEN to what I wanted, he just did what HE wanted to my hair.  I felt I had been punked that's how bad it turned out.  Like it was a malicious prank.  Then my mother in law said that she knew how awful Teddies was and would have warned me not to go if I had asked her beforehand. PLEASE IF YOU VALUE YOUR HAIR...WHATEVER YOU DO - DO NOT GO TO THIS SALON!" <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3713915017>   .

As she was cutting, I told her that I'd like an edgy, textured bob w/bangs, no layers. I ended up with an alright haircut. But it wasn't at all what I asked for (it actually was exactly how the stylist had her hair). Tons of layers, terribly cut bangs that wouldn't stay down. The bill was OVER $200!

Each page has 9 large thumbs with the name of the model or models underneath. There's a link to support on the upper right hand corner and links to all the video pages on the lower right below the thumbs on each page, and that's it. There's no ads, no extras and no bs, and since our last visit the site has also started adding dates on the 9 most recent updates so we can see when they were added.\nThere are currently 191 videos in the member area, 130 more than on our last visit, and each has its own page. On that page on the upper left is the model name and a small pic of him or them. There's a good sized description telling about the shoot, a link to email the webmaster. Next on the left comes a short Flash trailer of the video and on the right is a short profile, the duration and size of the video and the download link, which also tells the resolution of the movie.\nThe Uomo TV movies are offered in WMV format.

And this is where I have to re-assess my statement that these are amateur guys. They look like amateurs - well, most of them - but some of them fuck on camera like pros. Also a couple look like pro models, with handsome faces and sculpted bodies.\nWhile I'd like to see pic sets - even if they're only vidcaps - Uomo TV is doing almost everything right. Their models are hot latin guys who are horny and energetic, and they look like they're really enjoying themselves. The page layout is simple, but it's not unattractive and it is very easy to use.

_:nodee2a25524f4f59fd162a9ef1fd6b45b55 <http://purl.org/stuff/rev#text> "Jake Cruise is a horny older man who has found a way to get all the cock he can possibly handle. He started his own website and casts hot jocks, hunks and pornstars to do the shoots. There's plenty of fucking, sucking and jacking off - and a lot of the time, Jake gets into the action. Jake is 50 years old with silver hair and a sense of humor as well as a taste for all sorts of hunky guys. The site reflects Jake's personality and that's a good thing, so I'm looking forward to seeing what's new at Jake Cruise since our last visit.\nThe member area of Jake Cruise can also be previewed as part of the tour. The difference is while both members and guests can see thumbs of all the guys, only members can unlock the actual content. The member navigation links are on the left of the pages, and episode links are for the video and the pics (when there are pics) on the top of the page while on the right you will find a description of the shoot and the model written by Jake. These descriptions are very good reading.  While the tour claims the site updates once a week, in reality it has been adding 2 updates per week for some time, on Tuesdays and Fridays each week.\nI like the browse and search options.  If you want to browse the episodes in date order, just click \"all movies\", or if you prefer to browse by model, click \"model finder\".  For those who are looking for more specific types of content, the \"movie selector\" page has a list of many sorting options.\nJake has a way with his hands and his tongue. Both his massage videos, where he gets to rub guys all over their bodies. Jake is also always trying to talk the nervous straight guys into letting him kiss them, suck their cocks, drink their loads - and he frankly loves convincing a returning model to fuck Jake bareback.\nWith 420 videos, which is 147 more than on our last visit 18 months ago.  The videos inside Jake Cruise are available in 2 formats - WMV and Quicktime. The movies are shown in 2 sizes - called large and small - and you can choose to watch each movie in Quicktime clips or download the full video in WMV format.  The large videos are shown at either 640x480 or 960x540, the WMVs with bitrates between 1.1 Mbps and 2 Mbps and the Quicktime clips with a bitrate of around 1.2 Mbps.  Quality varies, the older videos average quality and the newer WMVs at good amateur quality.  There are also streaming WMVs in 2 sizes.\nMany of the videos also include a set of pics - sometimes vidcaps but more often digital stills. The digital stills are larger than on our last visit, shown at 640x950. The quality of the pics has improved also, the older pics are amateur quality or better and the newer at good amateur quality or better.  The pics show the action very well, although some sets are on the small side, with around 35 pics - most of the smaller sets are older or solo.\nI think Jake is living out a lot of guys' fantasies. Jake talks with the models before the shoot really gets underway so he gets to know a little about them - and so do we. He often gets to massage, stroke and suck all sorts of hot guys on camera.  Many are gorgeous hunks, and Jake has even been lucky enough to suck muscle god Zeb Atlas.  When he's not in the action, Jake gets to watch while horny men either jack off or suck and fuck each other.\nLet's talk about what's new at Jake Cruise.  There's less advertising, the site updates twice a week - which is one more  update per week than on our previous visit, the content quality is improved and all the videos are larger, even the older ones.  And the newer videos are now HD, shown at 960x540.\nJake Cruise is a lot of fun! The site is friendly and easy to use, and I like the quality of the models - mostly hunks and bodybuilders, but some amateurs and slender guys.  The DRM-free videos are good-sized and downloadable in 2 formats, and most of the vids come with a set of pics.

_:node5c4ce3e30cf78f2053cacede7eada <http://purl.org/stuff/rev#text> "I have had persistant back spasms and lower back pain for over 2 years and have had to rely on muscle relaxants to relieve the back spasms. This of course is very dangerous and ignorant but I was desperate. I was referred to Dr. Watson by Dr. Neustaedter in Redwood City (www.cure-guide.com). Dr. Neustaedter has been practicing Oriental Medicine (Doctor of Oriental Medicine (OMD), Licensed Acupuncturist (LAc), Certified in Classical Homeopathy (CCH)) for over 30 years and I highly respect his opinion. He suggested that I see Dr. Watson for my lower back pain and back spasms and within just 3 sessions I felt like a new man! He has the latest technology. Special software (receiving digital data via sensors strategically placed on your back) that analyzes your muscle movement and instantaneously displayed on a computer. The graphics (almost like 3D) are outstanding, showing you precisely why I had back pain. The visual capabilities of the software allowed a lay person like me to immediately understand his diagnosis. Dr. Watson then placed me on several high tech apparatuses, electrical therapy and also manual adjustments that finally got rid of my constant pain. Now I can sleep in bed at night without any major pain - a miracle!!! I am so thankful to Dr. Watson and he also the one of the most nice and caring men I have met and even a great sense of humor that will put you completely at ease!" <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3710139550>   .

_:nodea07b9af5b5bd8bd31f924248d5fdf28 <http://purl.org/stuff/rev#text> "I\u2019ve been using The Journal from DavidRM Software for many years, so many years ago that I can\u2019t recall the original reason for downloading it. Since then it\u2019s become a true companion with a wide variety of uses.\nThe Journal has two main layouts. Firstly there\u2019s the traditional calendar based journal which you can configure to create entries as page per day, a page per week, a page per month or, in fact, just about any date range you can think of. \nFor example one of my main uses for The Journal is as a weather almanac. In here I have three calendar journal categories. First journal has daily entries as a brief summary of the weather each day. Secondly I have a weekly category that has one entry for every week starting on a Saturday. Finally I have a category for the monthly climate reports that creates an entry on the first of every month.\nAs well as the calendar based entries The Journal also has looseleaf entries that can be used for general note taking or, in fact, to record any information that isn\u2019t particularly date related. These entries can also have sub-entries to create a nested structure for organizing your information. \nThe Journal comes with a host of additional features. These include:\n\nStop watch & count down timer for timed writing exercises\nColour coded \u2018topics\u2019 for categorizing and filtering information\nPosting direct from The Journal to a number of popular blog engines\nFull rich text entry into the journal with ability to create your own format styles\nSpell checker and thesaurus\nFull search capabilities\nSet events, tasks, appointments in the calendar and get pop up reminders\n\nThe list is pretty much endless so I suggest you go try The Journal for yourself. You get a huge 45 day trial period and the eventual purchase cost is very low." <http://www.davidhollingworth.com/2007/05/12/the-journal-reviewed/>   .

_:node786eaa27c985c3c19c4cd732c08558eb <http://purl.org/stuff/rev#text> "If you love cowboys and the rugged masculinity of their outdoor lifestyle, the Bad Cowboys tour is a must-see! It is quite simply one of the best tours I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of them. It's slick and professionally put together to look like an old western movie, and it does. It doesn't hurt that the guys on the tour are in cowboy hats, gunbelts and boots. Some are on horseback ridin' the range, some are feeding their cocks to old west farmboys and you'll find some outlaws there, too. So saddle up, pardner, as we ride on over to a look at the member area of Bad Cowboys!\nThe member area is pretty easy to figure out so I wasted no time - I went directly to the pictures section and took a look around. Bad Cowboys looks good so I was looking for quality and I found it. There are only 27 pic sets at this time, and some are actually part of the same set, but let me tell you these are great pics! I'm pretty impressed. The pics are shown at a screen size of 960x1280 and at very good quality. No scrimping here - most of the pics are over 300k each and every set can be downloaded in a zip file or enjoyed as a hands-free slideshow.\nAll the pics and videos have a wonderfully western theme and most take part outdoors. The men are pretty rugged, and sometimes they take advantage of poor honest farm twinks. What's even better, some of these guys have HUGE cocks! In fact the sex is pretty hot if you don't mind cute twinks taking on rough well-hung outlaws two at a time, taking one cock in his mouth and another in his ass. The Bad Cowboys content is entertaining and the sex will have you reaching for a towel.\nHigh quality is the word for these 640x480 videos that stream at a full 2064k! There are only 10 full videos, but the quality is very good and the western theme of the site is very well carried out, even down to the banjo or fiddle music the videos start out with. If you watch the streaming version, you will have to click on the movies and zoom to see them full sized or you can just click the download link to open each clip directly in your media player. Members on slower broadband will notice a hesitation as the videos play - this is because they are too big for your connection. Don't worry - just download the video to your harddrive and watch the entire thing. They play very smoothly and enlarge to full screen beautifully. One thing is for sure, though - this is NOT a site for dialup users!\nI love how the movies start almost as much as I love watching the fucking and sucking. Picture two saddle pardners riding their horses toward the camera - really riding, mind you. The music sounds like the music in a real western and you can hear the sound of the wind under it. In fact the only thing that broke the mood at all was the fact that these cowboys don't speak english. Too bad, but since the boys they mouth-fuck suck cock so well on camera, I forgave them ;)\nBad Cowboys members also get access to a pretty good sized collection of gay porn stories, but these were sadly not cowboy stories. There's a bonus section as well including a live feed and the rest of the sites in the network plus a second cam site near the bottom of the page that has quite a collection of popups, and some of the links are ads. Last on the page is a link to a bunch of free sites with plenty of smaller pics and lots of ads.\nThe catch here is that Bad Cowboys updates sporadically, and then only one clip at a time.  It's taken over 9 months to add 3 full videos, which is only partly explained by the fact that a video in 7 clips is added in 8 updates - one for each clip and one for the full video.  It is possible the site is no longer updating.\nWithout a doubt, Bad Cowboys has a great idea and have done a very good job mixing the western flavor and hardcore porn.  The cowboys and outlaws are rough and hunky in their western attire and the video and pics are outstanding quality and size. The sex is dirty with plenty of outdoor blowjobs and threeway cowboy/twink fucking. What disappointed me about the site is that they don't have much content and they've only added 3 vids in 10 months.  That's really a shame as I was looking forward to more updates.  Still, if you don't mind smaller sites and you love the old west and hot cowboy sex, why not check out Bad Cowboys!\nThings we liked:\n\n   Well carried out western theme\nContent is big and good quality\nVideos are downloadable\nNo DRM used\n\nThings we didn't like:\n\n Few updates \nSite is small and not growing very fast\n\nClick here to visit Bad Cowboys\nMembership prices ( CCBill\u00A0\nPaycom\u00A0)\n\nMonthly: $29.95 (recurring)\nQuarterly: $59.95 (recurring)" <http://www.gaydemon.com/reviews/Bad_Cowboys.html>   .

_:node13587a2a794c24c6a527f265f164a2c <http://purl.org/stuff/rev#text> "Warning: this is a fairly long review; but then the product has a lot of features.\nThis review is based on Paint Shop Pro version 9, the last version to be released by Jasc Software before they got bought out by Corel. Corel don\u2019t (or didn\u2019t at the time) allow online purchases using American Express cards and so prevented me from upgrading, though I did trial version 10. More of that later.\nI do a fair amount of photography in my spare time and so need a tool that will allow me to edit images and prepare them for printing or display online. I also do a bit of design for web sites and so I need a tool to create and manipulate gif, Jpeg and png images. I use Paint Shop Pro (PSP) as my tool of choice.\nPSP has a full set of image editing and manipulation tools for the digital photographer. Once you\u2019ve opened your image there\u2019s a simple \u201COne Step Photo Fix\u201D button for inexperienced users; but there\u2019s also full control over all aspects of the images composition including:\n\nBrightness and contrast\nSaturation, hue and luminance\nColour balance\nSharpness, softness and blur\n\nWithin each category there\u2019s a number of different tools and approaches you can use depending on your level of experience and personal preference. For example within brightness and contrast you can, amongst others;\n\nDo an automatic contrast enhancement\nUse sliders to control brightness and / or contrast\nUse curves\nCorrect shadows, mid-tones and highlights\nUse a full histogram (see the image at the start of this review)\nUse levels\n\nOther sub-menus give a similar level of choice. So much choice is there that it can be a little confusing for a beginner; but even the \u201CEnhance Photo\u201D menu lets you perform each step in the \u201COne Step Photo Fix\u201D manually so you can see what effect each step is having. This is a great way of learning how the different tools affect the image.\nAs well as adjusting images there\u2019s a number of cropping and selection tools. The latter include lasso (Freehand) and edge (Magic wand) selectors. You can create and save selections and masks either to file or to the alpha channel. \nDefects in your photographs can be simply edited out using the clone tool. One issue I face taking photographs in towns where I live is that all the electric cables are on poles strung across the street. I\u2019ve spent many a happy hour cloning these out of choice photographs. This is also very useful for removing dust specs from an image. There\u2019s a great red eye removal tool too for those ghastly flash images.\nIn addition to all the photo editing features you can use Paint Shop Pro for creating raster or vector graphics from scratch. I\u2019ve only dabbled in this area; but I have created by own business cards using this software and I think they\u2019re quiet acceptable. There is also an \u201CArt Media\u201D image type that allows you to \u2018paint\u2019 images. Again I\u2019ve not used this extensively as I found it very processor hungry; but I did have great fun producing an oil painted version of a photograph of my daughter. Given more time I think this tool could be used to produce some very attractive \u2018painted\u2019 images.\nHow do I think Paint Shop Pro stacks up against the other image editing contenders? I\u2019ve tried other software packages and this is how I feel PSP compares;\n\nAdobe Photoshop - PSP seems to have all the features of Photoshop and many are much easier to use in PSP. For example PSP has a live preview feature so you can preview the changes to the image before committing them. I couldn\u2019t find this feature in Photoshop. Also Photoshop is vastly more expensive that PSP.\nAdobe Photoshop Elements - A version of Photoshop with fewer features and so also fewer features than PSP. OK for a casual photographer; but check the price against PSP which has many more features.\nThe Gimp - is free under the GPL, it has a host of features; but I found the user interface to be very difficult to use and it was a struggle to find commands like image resize.\nMicrosoft Photo whatever - great for novices, hopeless for anyone with even half a clue what they\u2019re doing.\n\nIf I had a criticism of PSP it would be poor handling of raw files. It did open my Canon CR2 files after I upgraded my camera; but required a huge computing resource to do it and then did a very poor job on converting them. This may have improved since version 9.\nWhich brings me on to version 10. When Corel bought Jasc Software I wondered what plans they may have for PSP, I even thought they might dump it in favour of their existing products; but they came out with a new release reasonably quickly. What a disappointment!\nCorel had managed to completely dumb down the user interface in an attempt to make the product appeal to a less experienced audience. As far as I could see there was only one new feature for the experienced user and the rest was a tacky attempt at automating the image editing process. The results were pretty awful. This offered me nothing at all.\nIn summary Paint Shop Pro version 9 gives me all the non-raw image editing capabilities I could want in a package that\u2019s a fraction the price of Adobe Photoshop. The same features are in later versions, you just have to fight a little harder to get to them. \nBecause it\u2019s so well featured and such good value for money I give Paint Shop Pro five stars." <http://www.davidhollingworth.com/2007/05/30/paint-shop-pro-reviewed/>   .

_:node9cc352642536fa32e62eadc3a19149f <http://purl.org/stuff/rev#text> "I've been lucky enough to review Boy Fun several times, the last time being just over a year and a half ago.  Boy Fun is probably the best twink collection I'd ever seen. Every set features cute amateur twinks or college boys, and there are  so many sets. Since the last review, Boy Fun has continued to grow, adding new exclusive sets of the cutest and sexiest boys on the planet to their site. Boy Fun has hired their own exclusive photographers and added plenty of what they like best - boys, boys and even more boys! Let's go check out the member area of Boy Fun and see what's inside.\nThe Boy Fun member page is wonderfully easy to use. After a big pic of some twinks, the menu is on the left and a little info about the site is on the right. There are 6 picture categories - Amateurs, Teens, Athletes, Outdoors, Ethnics, Hardcore.  The pics links are followed by a link to Movies, to the model index, to the feeds, highest rated sets and to the highest rated models.  Immediately below is the site news and then come the updates.\nThere are 48 updates listed on the main member page, which covers around the last 16 days of updates. Every one is listed with a preview thumb, name of the model or models, date added and tells if it's a movie or pics. Boy Fun has a new update schedule - they now add updates 5 days per week, and each update consists of 2 pic sets and 2 videos. \nThe pics in each set are marked Licensed to Boyfun, Licensed Exclusively to Boyfun, Exclusive to Boyfun. The Licensed to Boyfun pics are not exclusive but can be seen on other sites. I'd guess judging by what I saw in the site at least 85% of the pics are exclusive.\nThere are currently 505 pic sets in the Hardcore Galleries. Every single pic set contains boys kissing, sucking each others' cocks, fucking and shooting loads of cum. There are some mouthwateringly cute boys here as well as college boys and jocks. There are no 28 year old so-called twinks that are so common on other sites - every model inside Boy Fun looks under 23 years old.\nBoy Fun currently has 2935 solo pic sets in 5 categories - Amateurs, Athletes, Ethnics, Outdoors and Teens. There's plenty of cute boys and hot frat guys in this section, all getting naked. You'll also find plenty of guys grabbing their hard cocks and jacking themselves off for the camera. There are over 1121 pic sets in Amateurs, 325 sets in Athletes, 184 sets in Ethnics, 263 sets in Outdoors and 1042 sets in Teens. Most of the newer sets have over 80 pics each - many have over 100 - although some of the oldest sets have less pics.\nAll the pic sets are available for members to download as a single zip file. This is a lot easier than downloading the pics one at a time, so if you'd like to save some of your favorite boys' pics to your harddrive, it's nice and easy. The older pic sets are pretty good stuff - they are around 512x768 and good amateur quality. The newer pics are even bigger and better, usually shown at 682x1024. The pics all range from amateur to excllent in quality and are all nice and large.  And most of the new sets let you choose standard size pics or their new HIGH-RES size.  If you go with the HIGH-RES pics, prepare to be impressed as they are shown at around 1125x1500 pixels!\nThere are currently 1032 movies listed at Boy Fun. Some of the oldest movies, listed on movie pages 40, 41 and 42 are available only as full downloads - there are no clips available.  The oldest videos are MPGs, and while they are pretty good quality, they take a while to download. The newer videos are shown in clips and are WMVs. The newest videos are WMV clips. Each is 6 - 8 minutes in length and are shown at a screen size of 640x480, streaming at around 1000k or higher. This means the new videos are both high quality and large. Some of the movies that aren't quite so new are shown at 320x240 and stream at around 700k. They are also high quality. All the videos have very good sound and show plenty of boys jerking off and sucking on cocks.\nThere are currently 1342 models listed in the Model Index. Many of the boys appear in more than one set, so if you want to see all the sets your favorites are in - or simply want to browse by model, this is the place to go.\nBoy Fun gives its members access to 9 bonus feeds and sites. One live feed is College Boys Live, which is a live house. Some of the feeds are actually full bonus sites like Cruiser Boy and Maximo Latino. And there is 1 ezine, titled DICK!\nOne more thing worth mentioning. Boy Fun has no advertising on its member pages and no misleading links. Unlike many paysites that try and sell you anything from DVDs to sextoys to memberships, Boy Fun treats its members the way I would like to be treated - with respect. The only things on the site that upsell are some of the live feeds, and Boy Fun warns members about this before they enter the feeds.\nIf you love 18 - 21 year old boys and you haven't visited Boy Fun yet, you're definitely missing out. With 10 new pic sets and 10 new videos added every week to an already huge collection of pics, movies and feeds, Boy Fun offers more than almost any twink site I've seen - and I've seen a lot of them. I recommend that anyone who loves smooth cute twinks and horny jocks visit Boy Fun to see what they have to offer.\nThings we liked:\n\nHuge twink collection\nMostly exclusive content\nRegular and frequent updates\nVideos are downloadable\nNo DRM used\nWell organized easy-to-use navigation\nDates on every pic set and video\n\n\nThings we didn't like:\n\nNo profiles on model index pages\nOlder videos are on the small side\n\nClick here to visit Boyfun Collection\nMembership prices ( EENT\u00A0)\n\nMonthly: $29.99 (recurring)\nQuarterly: $69.99 (recurring)" <http://www.gaydemon.com/reviews/Boyfun_Collection.html>   .

I was just coming in the place when a customer who came in with his wife raved, \"That was the best facial I have ever gotten\". \n\nWhile looking them up, I also found out that their Cumberland, RI salon was voted the state's best by the Rhode Island Monthly - they should be less bashful and let customers know that.

Lead stylist Stanley is a Newbury Street veteran and his style and technique (for both cut and color) are flawless - and without the attitude you might find at some other salons! \nAlthough I did not receive any skin care or massage, I did get a chance to explore the facility, which is well designed and offers an old Italian elegant feel. The floor plan is well laid-out and the decor is well equipped without seeming overly modern.\n\nEvery staff member I encountered, whether it was to check in or ask for a restroom, was charming and friendly.\n\nI have been a client of Stanley's for years and have suffered the attitudes at other salons so that I might walk away with one of his magic cuts, and I am delighted to report that he is finally at a salon that is engaging as he is. I look forward to exploring the other personal care services that Toscana has to offer and I would HIGHLY recommend Stanley to anyone who is looking for a superior cut or color." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/15240072960>   .

If they were Chinese I wouldn't let them cook my food.  Attitudes against Jews, Blacks, etc. I think that the main problem we have in this country are people who are hypocrites.  They say one thing and do another.  They say, \"I hate people who hire these illegals.\" Then, when they need to move or need cheap labor go to their nearest Home Depot to pick up illegal Mexicans. The same goes for the people who say don't hire illegals to pick vegetables or fruit but when faced with the possibility of paying $5.00 for a head of lettuce at Safeway they can somehow understand.  Or the people that say don't hire illegal immigrants and secretly hire and pay their nanny (who may not be legal) less than minimum wage.  Hey, they are just trying to safe a few bucks, right? That's the American way, right? Wrong! Real Americans aren't hypocrites. Real Americans will hire unionized fellow Americans to pick their fruit and patronize real American carpenters from the local union when they flip their homes to make money not cheap Mexican carpenters for half the regular pay.  The problem is that most Americans won't put their money where their mouth is.  Stop crying about an unfortunate accident that happened.  God bless the victims and their families but don't punish Una Mas Restaurant and their owners.  They are good people." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3710394329>   .

Particularly liked the sand-bottomed pool which was large enough for a decent swim (although very cold!).   Also enjoyed watching the sun go down with a glass of champagne on the Zanzibar Terrace.   Staff were very polite.\n\n\u00A0\nNegative reviews about the hotel:\u00A0Although it was only mid-September, there was an \"out of season\" feeling about the hotel, in that the restaurants were not all open for dinner - although the Fusion restaurant menu contained dishes which would have been available in the other restaurants, had they been open.   Also, we didn't specifically request a non-smoking room, believing that they would all be non-smoking.   The people in the next room spent quite a bit of time on their balcony smoking, which meant that we couldn't always use our balcony.   We also often had the smell of smoke in our room - possibly through the air conditioning.\n\n\u00A0\nThings to do near the hotel:\u00A0Loads of restaurants and bars in the Marina." <http://hotels.hotelopia.co.uk/hotel-the-lake-resort_algarve.html>   .

Friends that travled with us but staying at another hotel were in a very bad area, which when booking online you never know about.

_:nodec465121f8e986bf70fd8c33c1b926d1 <http://purl.org/stuff/rev#text> "We had settled on the car that we wanted- we just needed to buy it. The overall experience was excruciatingly painful, annoying, dreadful (or whatever synonymous adjective you prefer) until we drove out to Browns Nissan Dealership in Sterling with the car we wanted. \n\nWe started out with the dealership in Chantilly. We were told never ending details about the amazing deal we were getting from them. The deal seemed to be too good to be true for them. Not for us though. We had done extensive research on the vehicle, the options associated with it, and the general price range. The Nissan Dealership in Chantilly truly believed they were getting us an amazing deal. Any negotiating on our behalf was pushing it. Not only that, we were not even able to see the actual car until we signed documents stating that we were going to purchase that car. What?? The deal was that the car was not at this dealership but at another, and to retrieve the car, they were going to up the price on the car.\n\nI dont know if thats a normal practice in the car dealership world, but Browns Nissan was against the notion outright. The model of the car we wanted was also unavailable at Browns Nissan but our salesman made sure the car would be at the dealership within the hour and without any extra charge (they still had to pay a $700 some transfer fee for themselves). There were some other places around town we hit up as well. Needless to say, for us, some seemed sub par. \n\nWe entered into Browns Nissan just after 3.00 PM. and didnt leave until 9.30 PM with the car. Half the time we were just enjoying the great company our salesman, John Omidpanah. I though Id never say this, but it didnt really feel like we were at the dealership for too long: great staff, crazy amounts of information on every aspect of the car, and some pretty sweet deals. \n\nIn the end, it was John who made buying the car such a sweet deal. He was knowledgeable, courteous, honest, and, really, a great person. He had in depth knowledge of the options and the car in general. Remember, we had done our research on the car before going into shopping around and negotiating. We heard a lot of important facts about the car at the dealerships, but John was quick to dispel false notions of the car and was upfront with the cars true capabilities in various terrain. (One guy at a dealership even tried to persuade us into buying another car by sort of bad mouthing the car we wanted.) He was also very polite and well mannered. He always excused himself when he began to see that my family and I wanted to discuss deal he was presenting in private. Of course he offered us the amenities available at the dealership, but he surpassed my expectations of a chivalrous salesman when he opted to retrieve the car himself from another dealership and thus cutting down vehicle transfer costs (which he assured us we would NOT pay). However, it was his honesty mixed into his knowledge of the product he was selling that set him apart. He showed us shortcuts (i.e., buy this package and the option you want comes with it but you save $800 in the end, etc.). Halfway through his explanations, I got this weird feeling that he might not be trying to make money here. Instead, he got us a great deal. I love my car and I love what I paid for it.\n\nWe paid $4K less than the MSRP and an average of $2.5K less than other dealers around town. Weve already referred family members to Mr. John Omidpanah. He receives the highest marks from my family and myself." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3722953644>   .

I was given outstanding customer service.  Aaron offered me tickets to the recent Auto Show before I bought anything.\n\nThe car buying experience with Patrick was low pressure and Patrick explained all the options of the new car I wanted to buy.  There was some time between the purchase and final delivery of the car so while I was on vacation Aaron offered to add any options that I wanted to the car.  He had the clear bra put on for me so that when I picked the car up it was ready to go.  The delivery of the car was seamless and smooth.\n\nI seldom like the finance guys but I really liked the person I worked with at Brown's.  He ran a financing scenario for me so that I could understand my options.  I felt little pressure and was able to make a choice that I was comfortable with.\n\nI highly recommend this dealership.  I've bought cars from 4 different local dealers and this has been my best buying experience." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3722953644>   .

_:node4461adde82d4c6ff87d4201ec01b8428 <http://purl.org/stuff/rev#text> "So I get this e-mail from a buddy telling me Brown's Sterling Nissan is having a special on their new 2008 SUV lineup.  I wasnt really in the market for a new vehicle but my Pathfinder was getting old and I had my eye on the Xterra ever since it was remodeled in 2005 so I decided to look into it.  \n\nI'm very particular when it comes to making purchases. I do a lot of research and take my time to ensure Im making the right buying decision and that Im getting the best value possible.  This is especially true when buying a vehicle.   At this point, I already knew the Xterra had received excellent marks and had read many reviews, which rated it at the top of its class.  So I took the next step and scheduled an appointment.  My buddy knows Aaron Spicer who is the GM so I got his info and contacted him directly.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was greeted by Aaron who had an Xterra ready for me to test drive.  Instead of just passing me over to a sales associate, Aaron thoroughly went over all the features and options of the vehicle with me.  He answered my questions and offered to go with me on the test drive.  The impression I generally have is that most people in upper management are so focused on how profitable their business is, that they loose touch with their customers and do not really attempt to understand their customers individual needs.  Aarons attention to his customer clearly shows he understands where the focus should be.  \n\nAfter the test drive, we reviewed some pricing options for the SE and the Off Road versions.  His pricing was surprising low which confirmed the special they advertised was true and not just a marketing gimmick.  I told Aaron I needed a few days to not only decide on the version and options I would like but also on weather this was the right decision for me.  Aaron completely understood my needs and did not make me feel pressured to buy immediately.  Over the next few days I e-mailed Aaron with some additional questions which were answered promptly.  I finally decided on the Off Road version in black.  Although they did not have it in stock, they were able to find one with the options I wanted.  A few days later, I went to pick up my new 2008 Xterra.  The vehicle was washed and very clean.  I did notice a little bit of wax left over from the protective wrap covering the inside of the door but Aaron immediately got some cleaner and wiped it off.  The GM personally cleaning my new car!  Needless to say, I was very impressed!\n\nLike everyone else, Ive had my share of unfavorable buying experiences but I can honestly say this purchase was very positive for me.  The attention to the customer shown by Aaron and his staff was amazing.  The price I paid was more than fair.  In fact, this is the best deal Ive ever had on a vehicle purchase.  Although I know I am one of many customers who has bought an Xterra from Browns Sterling Nissan, I was treated to feel like I was buying an expensive Ferrari from Maranello, Italy." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3722953644>   .

I have been servicing my wifes Sentra (which we traded in) there for a few years and figured although the service dept runs perfectly smooth that buying a car would still be the normal hassle like at most dealerships.

The sales staff along with the sales managers treated us with the utmost respect and never once pressured us into making a sale.  The finance department worked with us well past closing one evening to make sure that our payments were to our liking.  All in all, a very pleasant purchasing experience.  \n\nWith regards to service. . .I have had all our cars serviced at Sterling Nissan and have had great success with the quality of workmanship as well as honest opinions as to what needed to be addressed on each car.  As a former member of the Nissan XTerra club I was very confident in sending any local Virginia business to Sterling Nissan whether it was sales or service related." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3722953644>   .

After I purchased my new 2008 I went back to find out if someone may have found my cd's.  While waiting in the lobby I noticed that a salesman was going through my new car!

They target women and treat them as without intelligence.The woman shopping in this case has very high earnings.The dealer  did not get to buyer finances in the looking for a car process.. Apparently,Two \"Jamaican\"Brown's salesmen dealt with these two women during this whole process and thought they would gang up on the two women and have fun insulting them.. A test drive was done with no problems. Then the  trade-in amount quoted by this dealer representative was $4500 below Blue Book for the trade-in car. They told her there would be at least an $1800 surcharge on the car for taxes,tags.. Tags cost in reality $349.. The whole shopping experience of these two women was negative at this dealership.Many women make a lot of money. Many are very educated. Many know more about cars these days than men.None of them deserve to be insulted. This IS 2008.We as a family will avoid ALL dealerships with the BROWN name. And certainly we are \"passing along\" our experience at work for as long as the subject of cars comes up in any future conversation." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3722953644>   .

The hotel is pleasant and comfortable. As honeymooners, we got an upgrade to an amazing room type (double-decker) with 2 bathrooms and living area, balacony, and all other room amenities. Breakfast is so nice and simple.\n\n\u00A0\nNegative reviews about the hotel:\u00A0Location was a little bit questionable (at first) until we got used to the area.\n\n\u00A0\nThings to do near the hotel:\u00A0Visit the near by palace, go on boat ride in nearby park, go to famous bull fighting arena on a Sunday (Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas)." <http://hotels.hotelopia.co.uk/hotel-room-mate-laura_madrid.html>   .

His longest stay was when I went to Galveston for a few days and, when I picked him up, he was so happy and you could tell he had been very well cared for.  They took some adorable pictures of him having play time and with one of the staff and several more.  I highly recommend using them any time.

The entrace hall is small and has a coat rack on one side and you are seated in what looks like a large dining room but with many tables in it. Not only is the decor quant but the food is fantastic.  I've been there a few times now and enjoyed all of it.  I would highly recommend their penne a la vodka .. it's amazing. \n\nThe food can be a little pricey, i think the penne is about $11-13.  I also recommend calling and making a reservation because it's unpredictable when others will also be jonesing for La Vecchia Napoli and it'd be disappointing to leave because it's too busy or too long of wait.\n\nKeep in mind, there really isn't parking at this place unless you look around on the nearby side streets, but they do offer valet parking and are very prompt with the car.\n\nPROS: Food, ambiance\nCONS: Parking situation" <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/15238249259>   .

This IS NOT how this restaurant used to be.\n\nI went there this Sunday evening with my wife and was badly disappointed with the lack of selection. It was as if the food were leftovers for the day, and even though it was dinner service, the restaurant had no intention of making new food.\n\nVery disappointing. With all the competition from other filipino restaurants that have newly sprung-up and is clearly taking all their customers away, you would think they would try just a little bit harder.\n\nWith an economy as hard as today's, it is not merely enough to lay dead and wait for the vultures, ya know?" <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3710739650>   .

With the identity of the bad guy revealed very early on, this is more an action packed, heart stopping detective drama than mystery novel.\nThe depth of this killer?s depravity is chilling, utilizing modern technology, as well as, chemical substances to incapacitate his victims Cutthroat continues to ratchet up the stakes. The inevitable showdown with detective?s takes a stunning turn, when Cutthroat discovers that the woman he considered his ultimate prey has found sanctuary in the arms of agent Chris Delone. Enraged and on the edge of absolute insanity, the killer simply adjusts his plans to include both Holly and the agent.\nParker writes with distinct voice and stylized action that is exciting and entertaining. A definite no holds barred, gutsy detective novel that takes the reader deep into the psyche of a social deviant that preys on the innocent.&nbsp;Although I would like to see a bit more character development, as individuals, to give the reader the opportunity to become emotionally invested in all aspects of the story, ?Look Into The Eyes of Evil? is a good read that sets a solid stage for future installments. \nI look forward to reading the entire&nbsp; Badge of Honor series.\nHappy Reading!

The only drawback for the \"serious\" golfer is that you are supposed to hit of of the astroturf mats on the tee-box of every hole. But the place is so well manicured, so nicely kept-up, and the greens are always lush (they could use a bit of a mowing as of this morning!) - for the price ($14.00 regular, $10.00 for Seniors) you just cannot beat it.There is a decently marked driving range (again - off the mats) and even a cheesy mini-golf course for the kiddies.Full service pro-shop - I've heard the golf pros and lesson plans there are first-rate and well-priced. And the coffee-shop/grill makes some really decent food.A real locals hang-out during the mid-week mornings.If you wanna complain about slow-play, this course is not for you! But if you want to spend a couple of quality hours with your short-irons...check it out!! The longest hole is 148 yards!" <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3711104187>   .

The staff there is very friendly as well.  This is a par three course so you will see a lot of beginners and the occasional group of five.

All said, the price is right, and I would recommend it for some laid back golf." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3711104187>   .

On top of this, they are so reasonably priced, it's amazing.\n\nThe place is neat, clean, and casual. Nothing too fancy.

I've been using mine for grocery hauling and have had loads ranging from 25-60 lbs. My route to the store includes streets with hills and singletrack with hills and ruts. I can't believe how well it handles it all. When loaded this thing is unbelievable. Unless you are hopping or going off a curb or rut in the trail, it may as well not be there.  I've actually looked back a couple of times to make sure it's still behind me. With the 3 position load damping system I can be sure for the right ride setting and I can also adjust the spring tension via a large \"bolt\" on top of the spring. That may be the root of the complaint for the guy who didn't like the shock. When I picked it up they had it tightened so much for shipping that the spring was useless. All you need to do is loosen it a couple of turns and you're good to go. I LOVE my Ibex and can't wait til next year when I get to take it on some real trips. I know it will fare well since my bike touring poundage will never exceed the weight I've already used it for.

Am in the process of replacing this with a 16\" fender IF I can ever find one that fits.  BOB should really consider offering a better one." <http://www.bicycletrailers.com/BOB-Ibex.pro>   .

I have owned my Ibex for over a year now. Believe me, the shock helps a great deal when you decide to jump that curve or haul a big load. On another note, the trailer is not heavy at all! I just had to write these brief comments on the trailer because I absolutely love it. Best bike purchase I ever made." <http://www.bicycletrailers.com/BOB-Ibex.pro>   .

And more plants than I have seen at a dozen local nurseries combined.  There is a beautiful garden path that you can walk through and see a variety of plants at home in thier natural environments. Plus acres of plants, flowers, shrubs, tree's, etc.  And the people that run the show are fabulous!  They are the sincerest, nicest people around.  They love the kids that come out, showing them the plants that smell like peanut butter and lemons and such.  There is also a little play area for your kids when you visit.  The prices are too bad either!  Very highly recommended!!!  If I could use 6 stars I would!\n\nPROS: Great place, heaven on earth\nCONS: none" <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3720164847>   .

This time around in Pasadena, it wasn't great at all.\n\nFirst off, I called to make a reservation since it was a Saturday night and I figured it was busy. I was told they don't take reservations or call ahead but that the wait for 2 people would be 10-15 min. By the time we got there, they quoted us 10-20 min wait time, which was understandable. 45 min later...we were finally seated. And only after returning to the hostess to ASK to be seated. I mentioned to the man seating us that she shouldn't be quoting 10-20 min wait time if it ended up being more than double that. He said there was a party of 20 that came right before us, which is fine but then why didn't the hostess call us back and let us know that?\n\nAfter we were seated, a temporary waitress brought us drinks and bread. When our regular waiter came back, he didn't bother to introduce himself, just asked what we wanted.\n\nI ordered Chicken Madeira, their signature dish, and in the center of my mashed potatoes was one large half of a potato with rotted black stuff in the center of it. Ew!\n\nI politely asked for the waiter to do something about this, and the waiter didn't even take my plate away. He just said okay, walked away and came back with a new side dish of mashed potatoes. A manager came and she removed  my plate and offered to remake my dinner. I told her just go ahead and make it \"to go\" since I had already lost my appetite. My guest and I had some yummy cheesecake to make up for this disaster of a meal.\n\nThe manager comped me my 1st and 2nd entrees which I thought was nice, although it still was a bumpy ride eating there.\n\nThe next day, I opened the \"new\" entree she sent me home with and what did I find? 4 black beans (how did those get in there?), two more rotted chunks of potato and a chicken bone in the mashed potatoes. Ew! Ew! Needless to say, I didn't eat this entree either!\n\nSeriously, I am considering calling the Health Dept over this. Some disgruntled cook is back there dumping trash and droppings into the mashed potatoes! Gross!!\n\nI appreciated the manager trying to help, but she should have checked the to-go order to make sure it was perfect. I will not be eating at this establishment again. I'll get better food from a dumpster dive!" <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3710282426>   .

Because of this, dining well in Pasadena isn't that tough. I never understood what the fascination is with CF. The line practically wraps around the building at almost all hours. The food is either too spicy, or not enough - never quite right. Portions are large but overpriced. Service is terrible.\n\nPROS: The decor is fun.\nCONS: The wait; the service." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3710282426>   .

It's nice to have a McCormick and Schmick's here.\n\nIt's a little weird to find the driveway. Though the restaurant sits in \"Restaurant Row\" at the Hughes Center, and can be clearly seen from Flamingo, the driveway is on Hughes Center Drive. Valet is available.\n\nThe ambience is great. Lot's of woodwork, great Tiffany lamps and other decorative glasswork, the obligatory mounted salmon and swordfish, as well as vintage seafood prints. The \"snugs\", small single table rooms, are great.\n\nPay close attention to your server. They have a wealth of information. Some of the things I heard:\n\n1. There's no frozen fish at M&S. Everything is fresh. They can run out of items, but there is sure to be something else I like just in case.\n2. Menus are printed daily (and can be customized for your occasion, as the first reviewer noted).\n3. In addition to fish, there are also great raw selections...oysters, sashimi, etc.\n4. Appetizers have some classics (calamari, prawn cocktail) and some unique ideas (tater tots stuffed with shrimp and crab).\n5. Steak lovers won't be dissapointed, and there is opportunity for \"surf and turf\", too.\n6. The wine list is great because of it's selections and price points. You don't have to spend a lot on wine, but you can!\n7. Service is right up there without being \"stuffy\". They take their job seriously while being good ambassadors for Las Vegas.\n\nOn my last visit (I go there often), I had something from a specialty menu featuring \"regional\" fish. Halibut wrapped in prosciutto, roasted in the oven and topped with nectarine chutney. I love halibut anyway, but this preparation was incredible. I also wanted to take advantage of a late running halibut season. I expect it to be out of season before my next visit.\n\nSave room for dessert (or as my server suggested, get dessert first!). They are all made in-house. Don't poke at the dessert tray. They're real!\n\nYou can spend more, but the quality may not be as good as M&S. IMO, you get what you pay for and more.\n\nLunch is served M-F only until 4:00PM." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3718393655>   .

Not only did they bring me previously refrigereated, COLD beef, but also inappropriately handled the situation when I brought this to their attention. The manager was rude and instead of apologizing, basically called be a \"lier.\" He denied the possibility of the meat being cold and unfresh. He was just loudly saying that he can't take it of the bill which I didn't even I ask to be done in the first place (I even said that I didn't want them to take it off the bill). So the the evening was pretty much ruined. A very bad experience overall. As a long-term customer I was very disappointed." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3710930308>   .

In fact, in 2002 we moved to Agoura Hills, and I still drive more than 25 miles to take my dog here because of the amazing care given. The staff is very friendly and helpful, I never have to wait long and the vets there put my dog at ease, and take great care of him. Sadly, a few months ago we had to bring in my 17-year-old dog to be put to sleep. Dr. Lowenthal took the time and care to explain to my kids what he was going to do and why it was the right thing to do. Of course, it was sad, but he made it as painless an experience as possible. About a week ago we finally broke down and got a new puppy. She was a rescue dog and I wanted to have her thoroughly checked out. So without hesitation I drove her the 25 miles and will continue to do because I know she will get the best care at Blue Cross pet Hospital." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3710996538>   .

I have spent over $5000 in stupid tests that were not even nessesary over the last 2 years. This last thing that sent me over the edge was that I took him in because he had a tender spot on his back. Doctor checkes him out and right away told me that he needed his lashes lazered out, teeth cleaned, xrayed for his back, ear problem, and quoted me $1400! I only got the x ray and the ear dropps, that alone way $500. They also prescribed me a type of doggie vicodent to where my dog had to be left in a kennel for a month because if he had any sort of activity he would become paralized. I got the xray results and the Doc said that he was just fine nothing was broken or hurt. 2 weeks later I took him to the groomers. The groomer told me that my dog had back pain and the reason his back hurt was because he had a skin infection. So, there was no reason for the x ray or the crazy dog vicodent. The groomer which is not a vet I might add was the one that told me what my dog's problem. He asked me where I had taken my dog and I told him. he told me that that place just rips people off and he used to work there. He said he coildn't believe all the money that place made from people desperate to help the pets that they love. I am furious! Please don't take your pets there." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3710996538>   .

When Keri, our dog, was diagnosed with cancer Dr. Lowenthal & Dr. Jones gave us our options.  Thanks to the excellent care given by Drs. Lowenthal & Jones, and the compassion given by the amazing staff at this hospital, Keri's cancer went into remission for almost two good years! When the cancer did come back, the hospital staff was  supportive in our decision not to do anything \"extreme\" but we did opt to see that she was comfortable. Keri passed away two years ago in her sleep at home on Thanksgiving Day!  I was able to get in touch with Dr. Lowenthal that morning (very early on a holiday) who said he would meet me at the hospital and not to worry....Long story made short, how many vets do you know would take the time on a family holiday to help deal with a pet that passed in the night?!!?  Dr. Jones helped ensure that when the time came to say good bye to two of the kittys (they were 12 and 17 respectively) that they were treated with the dignity and respect that one would want for their family. \n  I still have one cat left; Mieko is now 18 years old, and while he isn't exactly a spring chicken, he is still full of life and doing well  for an \"old man\".  \nI would never think of going elsewhere for my babies...Blue Cross may not be the cheapest as some reviewers have noted, but they are the best and are most definitely not the most expensive.  The care and the love that my four-legged children received and continue to receive is amazing.  I have always been given options and with those options, I have always been given a range for what the cost might end up. \nBottom line:  Great & caring staff + Talented and knowledgeable Drs. = WONDERFUL Hospital for your 4 legged babies." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3710996538>   .

The entire staff at Blue Cross Pet Hospital saved my cat's life!  I was unaware that my beloved 15 year old indoor cat had gotten out.  She fell asleep under my car, and I pulled out and ran over her, to my horror!  I ran her to Blue Cross, and they immediately began life-saving treatment.  I saw them work on her just as if she were in the ICU of a human hospital.  Her injuries were critical, and it took about a month of care in and out of the hospital, but her recovery was complete.  \n    During the process, we discovered that she had advanced kidney disease, and with the treatment they recommended, she live a very full, happy, 3 more years!  \n    They were also excellent in the care of our geriatric Golden Retriever, who lived until he was 16.  They always gave me choices in treatment...how aggressive we wanted to be, or whether we just wanted to let nature take it's course.  I do a lot of care for my animals at home, and they were willing to help me do that, in lieu of making money for recurring vet visits, which speaks highly of their ethics.  They are on the more expensive side, but their diagnostics are the best I have seen, and we have used many vets.  I recommend them all the time.  Especially if someone has a really difficult medical situation.  I have no doubt that they will get to the bottom of any problem, and do their best to solve it!

When our 180 pound Newfoundland collapsed outside our house on the sidewalk ten years ago, Dr. Lowenthal sent a truck and several technicians to our house to pick him up and bring him in, because we were unable to lift him ourselves. Before calling Blue Cross, we had called a couple of other vets who were unable or unwilling to help us.\n\nDr. Lowenthal is smart and professional and his office has always provided excellent care for our dogs. The office staff at Blue Cross is also friendly, professional, and clearly cares about animals. We have been pleasantly surprised when Blue Cross has made follow up phone calls after certain treatments to see how our animals were doing.\n\nRecently when we were on vacation, our house sitter took our two year old dog in to Blue Cross because of severe skin problems and allergies. Blue Cross took great care of her and she was in great shape again by the time we returned home.\n\nBlue Cross is a high quality, compassionate practice.

The last time they said he had heart problems and estimated us 654.00 on the high side of the scale for treatment and that is what is ended up costing. Then he had a sore on his foot and they charged $70 to just put a bandage on it - which I did not complain about - but then a week later they had the nerve to charge me over $45 just to remove it which anyone could have done including myself with no effort. They then said he needed to take medication for a couple months and the medication was another couple hundred dollars which I blew up at them and said I would get them at 1800PETMEDS which ended up being 1/4 of the cost.\n\nBottom line - They are very expensive, always asking to do things like blood test, urine, teeth cleaning, ear cleaning even when other vets have said there is no need for those treatments or test.

The moment I walked in, due to an emergency visit, I was greeted warmly by the receptionists. My dog had got run over by a car and couldnt walk on her legs, so two technicians ran out to my car to help me bring her in. They were very gentle and cautious with her and took her right away to the back. Moments later i found out that she had broken her hips and that she had to stay overnight for some more tests. The doctor personally came out and took me to a room to converse what was going on, he was very professional, seemed very devoted to his job, and was very generous. Few days later she went into surgery by a specialist doctor. The doctor himself would call and give positive feedback on how she was doing and made sure she got the best care. Even when visiting her, everyone was so considerate and it even showed through my dog's actions. Few weeks later, she came back home and she's doing better than ever. I still get calls from the hospital checking up on my dog and it feels great! The prices are very fair as well. I highly recommend this place if you want your pet in exceptional hands!" <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3710996538>   .

These veterinarians advocate and recommend the Rolls-Royce of care, but you are always in charge and can opt for the Chevy, or even the Yugo. They are tenacious about getting to the bottom of difficult diagnoses and call upon a myriad of specialists to help determine the best course of treatment for their patients.

He ended up staying there for 3 days.  They explained that they had no real explanation for his behavior and further neurological tests would have to be done to fully diagnose his episode- \"sometimes these things just happen.\"  When we finally took him for his follow-up visit after being back at home for a week, we were told that it was probably a reaction to a black widow spider bite. Hmmm... ?  They said his white blood count had been high and wanted to re-check it and also said his ears were \"musty\" and swabbed them.  The tech then ran out to show me the dirt on the swabs, etc...They also wanted to do all of these other tests and clean the ears and give him antibiotics for his ears and some gel as it looked like the beginnings of a possible infection, etc... When that estimate came back for  $289.00, I was so frustrated.  I only paid for the second round of antibiotics for the \"spider bite\" and the follow-up appointment fee-declining the rest of the treatment that I deemed unecessary.  The tech then told me that if I was not going to opt for the ear cleaning in their office, that I could buy an \"over the counter\" wash at their adjacent store.  NO, I AM SPENT ALREADY!!!!!   On top of that, we had originally paid for an Advantage flea treatment and they forgot to send us home with the medicine during his pick-up after the first visit. In our opinion they most likely didn't even treat our dog like they were supposed to with that medicine during his overnight stays as a patient. If we had not mentioned the fact that he still had fleas, we never would have known the whole Advantage procedure and that the product was a take-home remedy (even though they were supposed to start his first treatment while he was there) etc..\n\nWhen I conferred with our neighbors about the incident with our dog and asked them where they took their dogs for treatment, all of them had had similar experiences with Blue Cross.  All of them!  When I told one neighbor the price of our dog's stay and treatment, he immediately said \"Oh, you must have gone to Blue Cross.\"  They seem to have a reputation for hard selling of treatments and overall OVERPRICED service.  \n\nYes, they did call to check on him and see how he was feeling, etc... but for the fortune we spent that is the least they could have done.\n\nI will never go back there.

They told me after 6 hours they couldn't draw urine.  R U kidding- professional vets!  The owner brought her to me to help him do this!   After he squeezed under her belly with his hidden hand, 1 drop of blood came out.  very suspicious.  He consulted me and told me only full hospital emergency care and dozen of very expensive (around $5000)  tests, could save her.  In front of everyone in the waiting room, loudly he told me to sign a waiver because my cat would die if I didn't do as he said -- in front of everybody!  Well, my cat didn't die.  She lived for 8 more healthy years to 22.  \n\nAnother incident... a technician came in to recommend teeth cleaning with out even looking at my cat's teeth.  They wrote up a price quote for $500!  for teeth cleaning!   They also recommend a full declaw at $500 dollars!\n\nI find this vet's behavior very suspicious and unscrupulous.  I believe that they try to squeeze money out of vulnerable pets owners.  \n\nAfter the death scare, I would only go to Collett's Veterinary in Sylmar.  Collett only declawed one claw.  He said the others weren't necessary and the $500 dollar teeth cleaning was too expensive.  He did it for $120.

Since day one there have been all kinds of deals that the owner has come up with. From his 1cent rental days. YES THATS NOT A MISPRINT! To the yearly October 6 horror movies for $6.66 special. 99 cent family videos that you get for 7 days. Even on Election day if you bring in your voter's stub you get a free rental. This is just a few. There are regular specials like a new member gets 2 free when they rent one for signing up. Rent 3 games or movies for $6.99 - $9.99 with a large bag of chips or popcorn.\n\nUnlike the big store's even when there is always a slow long line you NEVER stand in line for long periods of time here. You are taken care of very quickly by the great staff in this place.With TV Shows and Deluxe Editions. The Tv shows are rented by the season... NOT BY THE DISC. Huge saving compared to Blockbuster and the rest. With the Special Editions brought in are always the best versions available. Many versions I have yet to even see at another store other than here. They bring in more then just special editions they bring in collector's editions that have more then the special editions.\n\nTheir late fees are pretty reasonable. 99 cents on regular titles and games. \n\nThe best part is if your a frequent shopper. They sell a prepaid card there that you can have 30 rentals for only $35.\n\nSaving the best for last....THEY DELIVER AND PICK UP your movies. So you never even have to leave the house.\n\nI've been shopping here for years and rarely ever need to shop elsewhere for something. I strongly recommend trying this place out.\n\nOh, and their selection of DVDs. It's the best I have seen. Forget the big boys...check out this place.\n\nPROS: Home Delivery, 10,000 Videos, Hard to find titles\nCONS: The place is small but good things do come in small packages" <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/5681685094>   .

Accompanied by three beautiful women, I was able to find this hidden gem next to 99cent store on Sunset in Silver Lake. Seriously, forget that I worked in this area for 2 years, I never knew this beautiful place was always available for all of us for the brunch...\n\nAtmosphere/Decor: 5 stars.\nBeautiful and enchanting. From the natural green color schemes of the patio, bamboo and short palm trees filled \"cliffs\" where beautiful decks of outside patio seatings lay, big umbrellas you see in South East Asia, and comfortable bench seatings with full of fluffy pillows, the setting is amazing. I made a huge mistake of not checking out the restroom.... or inside of the building for that matter.\n\nFood: 4 stars. \nSimple, straight forward food that leaves you pretty satisfied, but doesn't impress.  We had crepe filled with poached pears with mascaporne cheese ice cream, smoked salmon crepe, rainbow trout munier and one more thing my friend had I can't remember...  The execution of food is not nearly as beautiful as the surroundings you are eating in. The menu, presentation and the language of the menu, presentation of the plate, fine tuning of the cooking are all recommended if this place is looking for to be recognized for food.\n\nService: 3 stars.\nThe least memorable part of the experience was the service. The server was not knowledgeable or engaging. She didn't tell runners who ordered what, as we saw every single thing first came to the wrong person. The service was over all slow, resulting us to having to wait for 2 drinks for 5 minutes after the other 2 arrived, 10 minutes for a pot of tea, and leaving one entree missing for 5 minutes when other three were all there on the table.\n\nWith the help of beautiful company and the surroundings, I really had one of the best \"girls\" time in a long while. This will be my favorite spot for brunch in my favorite east side Hollywood neighborhood and I will be back." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/15240016777>   .

I really enjoy how relaxed the atmosphere is there. The girls are not constantly pressuring you to buy dances from them, and are usually very respectful of you. The inside of the club is kind of seedy in a good way; the walls are all mirrored, vinyl seats, and the constant flashing of pale pink lights. Its like straight out of a late 70s movie or something. Ive heard them play New Order, JJFAD, and The Human League which is a welcome break from all the most current Hip-Hop and Metal that will be played in most other clubs.

It's mainly Mexican inspired food, but that doesn't make it any less delicious.  The menu isn't huge, but the food is flavorful and very filling.  The drinks are great.  The Pink Taco margarita is very strong (I watched the amount of tequilas that were poured in and realized I should only have one since I was driving home!) and the raspberry mojito is delicious as well.\n\nThe atmosphere is young and hip, with music blasting, you get a lot of talent agency people there in the evening since CAA and ICM are across the street.  The staff is all attractive, especially one of the bartenders.  And who doesn't like to be served by a hot bartender?  They know their audience well." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/15240073436>   .

Although we had reservation both the table and food was an incredibly long wait.  In addition they sat us in a completely different section than we had been promised to have when I made the reservations.  They continued to forget our drinks and every time we reminded the staff they gave us a malicious response.  Our waiter was more concerned with gossiping with his colleagues than assist our table.  Towards the end of evening as it was getting chilly I asked the manager to turn on the heating lamp because the busboy turned it off while he was cleaning our table.  He cruelly refused, began snapping his fingers and basically became violent with his foul language and demeanor.  In an error in judgment, we decided to stay for the birthday girl.  Since the restaurant turns into a club the staff began removing our chairs from the table before we finished our desserts and drinks.

The happy hour (4-7pm) prices on weekdays are competitive with other places in Pasadena (beer $3, food $4, wine in big glasses $5) and you can also order reasonably-priced appetizers from their standard menu. The $4 Pepperoni Pizza is spectacular.\n\nService isn't always fantastic, but I certainly haven't ever had the negative experience of other reviewers.

And it never ceases to amaze me how great their ice cream is.  What's special about Fentons?  The ice cream is made on site (hence the creamery title) and you can purchase their ice cream to go.  The portions are huge, prices are very reasonable,  and the service is fast.  There's usually a line out the door and around the building on the weekends and at night (open to 11pm on everyday and Midnight on Fri and Sat).  Fentons is a local landmark and many generations have been going there for years.  Fentons is also a  great place for the family.  I've only ordered the ice cream, so I have no idea what the other food items (burgers, salads, etc.) are like.  But if their ice cream is any indication of the quality of their other foods items, I'd have to say the food should also be great.  Oh, and they take reservations!\n\nPROS: Best ice creamery in the Bay Area. Casual and nostalgic atmosphere. Very Reasonable prices for the amount of ice cream you get. Popular among the locals. Great for birthdays. Just go there already.\nCONS:" <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3710764273>   .

Just as expected, things start to happen once their 30 day' warranty' is up, then you are screwed, even with things that were wrong when you bought the car. I was promised that the things that were wrong were taken care of prior to bringing the car home.  I found out past 30 days that they were NOT. Spoke to the service people including the manager and they would do nothing, literally telling me that it was my problem now. Nasty, condescending treatment, shoulder shrugging 'don't care' attitudes from all whom I dealt with in the service department. I will NEVER go back there again, even though I have a so called joke of an extended warranty for repairs there. I'd rather pay extra to have my car repairs done at a trustworthy place where folks have integrity. Carmax in Raleigh doesn't deserve one more dime from me and I am sorry I ever went there to begin with.

Believe me, I have many better ways to spend a Friday evening than enduring your hostile attitude and insulting comments.  We bought our last car from the Raleigh Carmax and have always lauded the great service.  However, based on my recent experience, I must acknowledge that customer service at this location has gone the way of the dodo.  Mr. Frank Bates, your title may be \"sales consultant,\" but you are still a used car salesman, and a poor one at that.  You may want to consider changing your title to \"sales repellant,\" it would be more accurate.  Raleigh NC Carmax SUCKS!!!!" <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3717473473>   .

While we were happy with the car we bought I don't think that we would buy another one from Carmax again. There were several issues that we had that we needed to be the ones to follow up with. The customer service was below par. While they do have a great selection of makes and models, the way we were treated will be what stands out in our mind with Carmax. One positive thing is that they do have a room for children to play in while you are looking at cars." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3717473473>   .

Little pricey for me during regular hours, but worth every cent if you like a challenge.  Fairways were excellent.  Tons of sand traps.  Large, undulating, well manicured greens.  Comparable to courses in Myrtle Beach but only 30 minutes from Lexington. Can't say enough positives about the course and can't wait to go back.\n\nPROS: Club Cars, 4 tees, nice elevation changes.\nCONS: No course diagram on score cards" <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3714923865>   .

My only prior experience with jewelry stores were those in the mall that all sell the same basic stuff, or the high end places that cost the earth.  \n\nWhen I went to Classy, I tried to not have preconceived ideas.  I asked Ned to make a custom piece for me, incorporating my Mom's and Dad's birthstones.  He was courteous, professional and exacting.  As the customer, I was always right and he went above and beyond to make sure I was happy.  My ring was stunning.  It was even more beautiful than I could have hoped for.\n\nI then had Ned design another piece, and another and another.  I am now a year in to my jewelry friendship and I will never buy from anywhere else again.  Every piece Ned has created for me has been more beautiful than the last.  \n\nNed and Phil are consummate professionals who welcome a challenge and who truly have a desire to make a woman happy with her jewelry.  They have a passion and a flair for what they do so impeccably.\n\nThank you gentleman, for a job VERY well done." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3718240948>   .

I had been looking to build a custom engagement ring and had a specific design in mind. I had heard about the jewelry exchange and thought that with all the vendors in the building someone could help. I must say, upon first walking in, the center is a bit overwhelming. I took a full lap of the place, speaking with several jewelers before meeting Phil (a very professional young man that works with Ned). Phil's approach to working with me was helpful, educational, and without pressure. I then met Ned, who taught me a lot about diamonds and settings, and then proceeded to help me put on paper the concept I had in mind. All in all, it was a great experience, taking an idea in my head and turning it into reality. Because Ned knew that I was hands on, he invited me to inspect and approve every step along the way, and it was cool to have seen the evolution of the ring through the various steps. Since then, I have purchased a Journey necklace and had my wife's wedding band custom made to match the engagement ring. Everything that he has produced for me has been well crafted and above and beyond even my high level of expectations. I think that trusting someone is critical to working with them, especially on bigger ticket items. Ned has always been honest with me and has quoted me fair prices and if he ever adjusted his prices after we have discussed what I was looking for, it was downward. All in all, I have highly recommended Classy Diamonds to my friends and family and am confident that Ned and I will work together for many years to come." <http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3718240948>   .

I was shocked that he could make me that exact necklace. When I went in to pick it up, it was absolutely gorgeous! Since then I have purchased several pieces from Ned. He is always professional and helpful, and his work is amazing. He recently made me a ring for my husband. I had seen it in a magazine, and he was able to make me the same thing for a lot less, and it looked even better than the original.

This bookstore is quite small compared to the regular bookstores I visit, such as Borders and Barnes & Nobles, but A Clean Well Lighted Place For Books is in a league of its own.
